          <h3>A little about me</h3>
          
        <p class="problem__p-1">
          

          I’m a user experience designer who loves to code. I’m based in New Bedford, Massachusetts. 
          
          I’ve been designing in some capacity most of my life, my early years were spent studying architecture and designing floor plans in AutoCAD. In my attempts to teach my children to code I discovered my own love for programming. I began working through online programming courses and attending Girl Develop It meet ups. For the more than a decade I have made a living as a knitwear designer and continue to design knitting patterns when I find the time. </p>
          
          <h3>My Journey into UX</h3>
          <p class="problem__p-1">
          
          My journey into user experience design evolved from building websites for friends. In most cases a friend would tell me what they want for a website and I would go and build a beautiful site. I soon realized that this method of design did not work. There was no discovery, no problem solved and no value added. I began to reevaluate my process which lead me to study user experience design and design thinking methodology. 
          
          I went on to complete a nine-month mentorship focused on user experience design, and frontend programming.  (I learned how to observe users, conduct interviews and run user testing in order to really understand the needs and goals of both stakeholders and users. </p>
          
          
          <h3>Life Long Learner</h3>
          <p class="problem__p-1">
          
          I absolutely love to learn and spend a good portion of each day learning through online courses, listening to design interviews by High Resolution, reading design & development articles, and keeping up with the latest work of the IDEO team.</p>
          
          
          
          <h3>Beyond Design and Development</h3>
          <p class="problem__p-1">
          I’m a wife, mother of two daughters, and woman of Christian faith. I’m passionate about prison reform and serving families affected by incarceration.
